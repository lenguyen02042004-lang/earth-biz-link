        <h2>1. Start with a trusted global business directory</h2>
        <p>
          A global business directory is the fastest way to build a shortlist of potential
          partners across markets you don&apos;t yet know. Directories aggregate verified
          company profiles, industries, contact details and social presence in one place.
          On <Link to="/explore">GlobalBiz.Connect</Link> you can filter companies by
          country and industry on an interactive map and open a full online business card
          in one click.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Verify the company&apos;s legal identity</h2>
        <p>
          Cross-check every promising lead against the local trade registry (for example,
          the SEC EDGAR in the US, Companies House in the UK, or the National Business
          Registration Portal in Vietnam). Confirm the registration number, incorporation
          date, active status and registered address match what the company advertises.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Assess reputation and track record</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Read independent reviews and news coverage.</li>
          <li>Check certifications, awards and membership in industry associations.</li>
          <li>Ask for at least two references from existing international customers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Run financial due diligence</h2>
        <p>
          For meaningful deals, purchase a credit report from a provider such as
          Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Experian or Coface. Look for payment behaviour, litigation
          history and beneficial ownership.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Validate operations before you commit</h2>
        <p>
          Request product samples, schedule a video walk-through of the facility, or hire a
          local third-party inspection service. For services businesses, run a small paid
          pilot before signing a long-term contract.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Protect the relationship contractually</h2>
        <p>
          Use an NDA before sharing sensitive information, agree on Incoterms for physical
          goods, and specify the governing law and dispute-resolution venue in every
          contract. For cross-border payments, prefer escrow or letters of credit until
          trust is established.
        </p>

        <h2>Where GlobalBiz.Connect fits in</h2>
        <p>
          GlobalBiz.Connect is a worldwide B2B directory built around an interactive 3D
          map. You can browse companies by <Link to="/countries">country</Link> or by
          industry, save contacts, exchange digital business cards and follow suppliers
          you want to monitor — all from one profile.
